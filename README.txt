NOTE: As of 4/30/13, we have moved the home of the WavefrontOptics toolbox into the isetbio repository.  See https://github.com/wandell/isetbio.
We have left this here for now, but may make the repository go away once we stablize the isetbio version.  DHB.

*********************

The Wavefront Toolbox is a Matlab toolbox written to convert wavefront measurements (usually derived from adaptive optics) into point spread functions.  

The toolbox can be coordinated with the Visual Systems Engineering Toolbox (VSET), another Matlab toolbox on gitHub, that simulates the front end (image formation and encoding) of biological systems.
